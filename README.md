# ElvUI_VisualProcs

What's different?

I only added proc data for Predatory Swiftness and Berserk (for cat form) for my feral druid.
The proc graphic is borrowed from Shaman's Maelstrom Weapon since I couldn't find the actual file for Predatory Swiftness

It only works for level 80, as I didn't bother with finding anything other than max rank spells.
